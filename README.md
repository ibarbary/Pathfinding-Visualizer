# Pathfinding Visualizer
- Built React application for real-time visualization of pathfinding algorithms such as Breadth-First Search,
Depth-First Search, and Dijkstra's algorithm
- Implemented 6 different algorithms, including 3 pathfinding algorithms and 3 maze generation algorithms,
providing users with a comprehensive tool to understand the execution of the algorithms and compare them
